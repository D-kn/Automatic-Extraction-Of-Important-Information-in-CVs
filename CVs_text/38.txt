 Aim: 

The main aim of this project is to control the basis parameter of a
vehicle.   Different   sensors   have   used   in   this   project   to   measure
various parameter like Temp. Sensor have used to get the temp.
Value. This Project implemented on Blue board using external CAN
circuitry.   

Software/Hardware used:        Keil IDE, Blue Board(LPC 2148) 
Programming Language:

Embedded C

 Title:
Aim: 

                Robotic Arm control using an Android Device.

We create an application in android which would allow the user to
control the external hardware such as Robotic Arm in our case via
Bluetooth   so   we   build   that   application   in   Eclipse   IDE   which   can
transfer the data from Bluetooth of android device to the Bluetooth
module which is connected to our microcontroller (AVR) and this data
is used to drive the motor connected to the movable parts of robotic
arm.

Software/Hardware used:        AVR studio, ATmega16 board.
